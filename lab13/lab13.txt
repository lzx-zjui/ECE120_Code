Question 1: Describe the errors that occur when trying to assemble lab13.asm. Identify the cause of each error.

line 14: No .ORIG.
line 17: The constant X3010 in the LD instruction is outside of allowed range.
line 19: There is one more "," in the ADD instrcution.
line 30: The constant X300F in the LD instruction is outside of allowed range
line 32: BRpz should be BRzp.
line 35: The constant X3011 in the ST instruction is outside of allowed range.
line 43: There is no .END.

Question 2: For each label in the corrected code, write down the corresponding memory location. 

OUTERLOOP         x3004
INNERLOOP         x3005
INPUT             x300E
ZERO              x300F
DECREMENT         x3010
RESULT            x3011

Question 3: Between using labels and explicit memory locations/offsets, which one makes the most sense, and why?

I think using labels is better. By using lables, we do not need to consider PC and offsets to find out the address, which is easy to get it wrong.
